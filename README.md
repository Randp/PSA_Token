A pet is not an impulse adoption

If you’ve longed for a dog, hankered after a hamster, or craved a cat for as long as you can remember, making that dream come true can be a wonderful thing. However, the idea of getting a pet is very different from actually owning one. Suddenly you’re responsible for providing another living, breathing creature with the right environment, food, training and companionship – and it’s a really big deal. 
There are people who don’t have enough money, and there are people who don’t have time and energy. 

We can connect them with a smart contract to do the adoption together.
