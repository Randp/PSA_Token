A pet is not an impulse adoption

If you’ve longed for a dog, hankered after a hamster, or craved a cat for as long as you can remember, making that dream come true can be a wonderful thing. However, the idea of getting a pet is very different from actually owning one. Suddenly you’re responsible for providing another living, breathing creature with the right environment, food, training and companionship – and it’s a really big deal. 
There are people who don’t have enough money, and there are people who don’t have time and energy. 

We can connect them with a smart contract to do the adoption together. 

The PSA voting is for the voting functoin.

The PSA contract is deployed in Ethereum Ropsten Test Network, the address of the contract is 0xad43e893a498fb0f73c04848e433d458591e92d7

Will implement the voting function to the Ethereum Ropsten Test Network soon, You can now add PSA Token as Custom Token in MetaMask with the address.
